# Insurance Claims & Preauthorization Analysis  
Healthcare SQL Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This project simulates a healthcare insurance claims and preauthorization system to analyze claim volume, approval rates, costs, and utilization patterns. It demonstrates how clinical and administrative data can be used to support insurance operations, utilization management, and cost control decisions.

## Objectives
- Analyze insurance claim workflows
- Evaluate approval, denial, and pending claim trends
- Identify high-cost providers and procedures
- Explore preauthorization decision patterns
- Demonstrate healthcare-focused SQL analysis

## Data Model
The project uses six interconnected tables:
- members (insured patients)
- providers (hospitals, clinics, pharmacies)
- procedures (billable services)
- claims (insurance claim headers)
- claim_lines (services within each claim)
- preauth_requests (prior authorization workflow)

## Key Analyses
- Claim volume by status
- Approval rate calculation
- Cost analysis by provider
- Procedure utilization patterns
- Preauthorization decision breakdown

## Relevance
This project reflects real-world healthcare insurance workflows and demonstrates how data analysis can support utilization review, preauthorization, and insurance operations roles.

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- SQL
- Relational database design
- Healthcare insurance concepts
